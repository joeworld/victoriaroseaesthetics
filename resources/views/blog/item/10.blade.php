            Is your skin needing a little love? The current pandemic crisis may be elevating stress in your life, 
            and trust me when I say, your skin is too. Stress wreaks havoc on your skin appearance instead of it 
            feeling rejuvenated,fresh, and calm. When life is stressful, your skin is one of the first places you 
            will see that manifested.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many ideas about what to do at home to keep calm during a pandemic. I am here to tell you your 
            skin needs to feel relaxed too. And whileI would love to have a button here to say, come on in and let's 
            chat, your skin will benefit from some loving attention while you are staying home.

                Make time for your skin! 
            </h4>
            <p>
                There are some incredible ways to pamper and calm your skin during stressful times, but here are a few 
                of my absolute faves from <a href="#">ZO Skin Health.</a>

            <h6>
                SULFUR MASQUE 
            </h6>
            <p>
                This is an excellent go-to treatment for acne! This instant hydration formula combats dryness but 
                also is fantastic for treating moderate to severe acne. You can apply this facial all over the 
                face or as a spot treatment for mild acne. The beauty of this mask is that 10% of sulfur and kaolin draws out 
                the dirt, bacteria and impurities while decreasing excess oil production. Use as needed, up to 2-3 times per week.

            <h6>
                ENZYMATIC PEEL 
            </h6>
            <p>
                Does your skin need some brightening, tightening and exfoliation? Well, this is your mini at-home 
                chemical peel treatment to replenish and love up your skin! The Enzymatic Peel is super gentle on 
                your skin but with the powerful ingredients for deep exfoliation, including glycolic acid for skin
                resurfacing and Bromelain, which is an effective anti-inflammatory. Your dull looking, sun-damaged 
                or congested skin will love the results! This DIY peel has no downtime and you can treat your skin 
                to it safely once or twice a week. 
            </p>

        <div class="blog-subtitle">
            <h6>
                BRIGHTENING SHEET MASQUE 
            </h6>
            <p>
                This single packaged Masque or bottle is brightening magic! I love to pair it with the Firming Serum 
                with Zo Skin Health to seal in all the goodness this treatment offers. After toning your skin, apply 
                your favorite serum and let it dry for 60 seconds. Once dry, you can spread the sheet mask on your face.
                This product has excellent hydrating and calming ingredients like green tea,vitamin E, and Aloe, to 
                name a few. This luxurious formulation ensures radiance and more even skin tone and texture to your 
                skin. You can treatyour skin to this weekly. Your skin will love this luxurious treatment that will 
                leave it feeling beautifully hydrated with a brightened glow.

            <h6>
                RADICAL NIGHT REPAIR  
            </h6>
            <p>
                This powerful retinol Peel is fantastic for anti-aging and pigmentation. There is a word of caution, 
                though! Radical Night Repair is indeed "radical," so this peel is for you ONLY if your skin has had 
                some exposure to the beauty ofRetinol. This aggressive peel stimulates new cell activity and collagen 
                in aging and sun-damaged skin effectively and quickly. Retinol is terrific, but skin requires 
                acclimatization to it (Blog to come about important things to know about Retinol!). This treatment 
                is only recommended 2-3 times a year and is for users who have been on Retinol 0.5% or higher for a 
                minimum of 4-6 weeks. You can do this treatment for three days in a row morning and night(five pumps 
                for mild, eight pumps for moderate, ten pumps for aggressive).There is downtime for this treatment 
                because your skin will experience lots of peeling, but once your skin heals, the results are amazing! 
            </p>

            With any home facial treatment, always make sure to cleanse, exfoliate with exfoliating polish, and 
            tone with complexion renewal pads before you begin.
