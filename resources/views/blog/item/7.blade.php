        </div>
        <p>
        With so many different types of procedures to go with, I am often asked about what is going 
        to give the best results and bang for my buck in my clinic.
        </p>
        <h5>THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS.</h5>
        <p>
            As much as we love to celebrate the decade markers with special birthday celebrations, the truth 
            is that we not only think about what we want to do in the coming decade but also what it will hold 
            for us in terms of aging. And the dream is to do it gracefully.
        </p>
        
        <h5>
            THINK ABOUT IT!
        </h5>
        <p>
            We do a lot of comparing naturally. Comparisons can be dangerous but also can provide benchmarks and goals. 
            No one is exempt from wanting to age gracefully. Knowing what to expect and how to do that in an enhanced 
            natural way is a positive goal to have, and trust me, it is the aesthetics dream.

            At Victoria Rose Aesthetics, we believe every man and woman should look and feel their best, and love to help 
            that happen. We are our own worst critic,so a positive and realistic mindset is key to overall beauty and wellness.

        <p>
            Knowing realistically about when to begin thinking about cosmetic services and seeking consultation about 
            realistic goals can help

            And let's face it. Not everyone ages the same. Our genetics, how your parents took care of your skin as a child 
            and how you now take care of your skin can make a difference for your skin health. But if you are wondering what 
            to expect throughout every decade, here are some general guidelines and aesthetic treatment plans to support you 
            through it.

            <h6>
                YOUR DEFINING 20'S. 
            </h6>
            <p>
                What you do before the age of 25 for your skin will dictate happy skin as you grow into adulthood. The first signs
                of aging start beginning min-twenties on the skin's surface with fine lines that lead to wrinkles. The 
                most important advice we can give is establishing regimented <a href="#">skincare</a>  routines with 
                medical-grade products and wearing that SPF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your 20’s are all about prevention, and a great preventative anti-aging treatment is what I like to call 
                “baby Botox”, a gentle introduction to injectables that will have lasting preventative benefits later in life
            </p>

            <h6>
                THE THRIVING 30'S 
            </h6>
            <p>
                When you are in your 30's, life, work and children can make self-care challenging to prioritize. Even if 
                you are rocking your life, your skin may begin to look more tired and less radiant because it IS more 
                tired, and so are you. Modelling skincare routines and SPF consistency will be a gift to your family and
                you. The '30s is the time when a non-surgical procedure may help replenish the life into your skin. 
                Slowing down your muscles active movement with <a href="#">Botox/Nuceiva</a> or facial treatments 
                is a great non-invasive way to help you continue to feel young and avoid further wrinkles.

                FABULOUS IN YOUR 40'S 
            </h6>
            <p>
                Life doesn't slow down in your 40's, but your skin does. This is when your face lines begin to appear 
                more evidently, especially if you smoke, sleep poorly or have not protected your skin with medical-grade 
                products or SPF. You will start to see more wrinkles in the forehead  and around the eyes and deepened
                lines around the face. Moisturizing becomes non-negotiable because dryness and dullness become far 
                more evident in your 40's. Botoxor Fillers may be a great solution to complement these lifestyle changes.
                Treat yourself to a <a href="#">lip filler</a> or eliminate dark eyes to boost your confidence and 
                maintain that youthful appearance.

                FANTASTIC FIFTY’S
            </h6>
            <p>
                Most people in their 50's who have been proactive in caring for their physical appearance and overall 
                wellness usually will embrace this stage of their life.That being said, our skin does experience a 
                natural breakdown of collagen and elasticity, combined with the effects of sun damage, can play havoc 
                on our skin health. Ramping up your skin products to include products such asRetinol and Vitamin A 
                infused moisturizers can make a difference in slowing that process down. Finding treatments that are 
                safe and effectively lift and tighten your skin will make a massive difference in your aging gracefully
                goals. Popular treatments fifty-somethings love are Botox, Fillers and skin tightening treatments such 
                as micro-needling can yield some fabulous results for your skin stage.

                If you are late starting on a "graceful rejuvenation, lavish beautification" plan for your skin, it 
                is your time.  I love helping others live their best life and age gracefully with the wellness and 
                confidence of natural-looking, beautiful results.
