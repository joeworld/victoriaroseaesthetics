        </div>
        <p>
            If you are a Bride to be, Mother of the Bride or groom, bridesmaid,  renewing your vows, celebrating a 
            monumental anniversary or looking forward to are union at any point, then this blog is for you!   
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is some straight talk about how you can get ready for the big day and looking your best with thoughtful 
            planning and the creative artistry of your cosmetic practitioner
        </p>
        <p>
            Many details need to be sourced, planned and booked for your big day. Hair and makeup, nails and grooming 
            all are essential parts of those many last-minute details for your big day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Medical aesthetics are different. I share your goals along with you! You want to have you look and feel 
            your best on what could be the most important day of your life. Ensure your aesthetic nurse is trained and 
            able to see your vision and is committed to helping you look and feel fabulous on your special day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I expect nothing less of excellence to ensure you are getting the perfect looks in a relaxed and memorable way.
            But it does take some planning, and it certainly cannot happen the week of the wedding as so many of the other 
            cosmetic details.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not the time for trial and error. You want a sure boost to your look and optimize natural-looking 
            results for all those photos.

        <div class="blog-subtitle">
            <h4 class="handwritten">
                I got you. 
            </h4>
            <p>
                Here are the timeline details and my top recommendations to help you plan to feel fabulous and enjoy optimal 
                results for your special day.
            </p>

        <div class="blog-subtitle">
            <h4 class="small-all-caps">
                TRY IT OUT.
            </h4>
            <p>
                If you have the planning time, I highly recommend trials of new procedures. Trials minimize the stress and 
                guesswork out of the process and its results for you. It allows the bride or bridal member, and cosmetic 
                artist an opportunity to chat about the wedding and the aesthetic vision.

                CHAT AND PLAN IT OUT.
            </h4>
            <p>
                When you are planning to try or undergo cosmetic treatment, you will have one on one time with your 
                artist's to discuss your ideal bridal look for the special day.  Creating a collection of previous photos
                and ideas, being able to identify will help your aesthetic nurse understand your vision better. But if you
                have no idea what you want, but know you want something, I will offer suggestions and ideas because I 
                absolutely love to enhance your natural beauty at Victoria Rose Aesthetics. My priority is to make sure 
                you feel comfortable and confident for the wedding day or whatever special event you are planning.

            <h4 class="small-all-caps">
                SKIN CARE STARTING NOW.
            </h4>
            <p>
                The most important thing I can emphasize is that if you haven't begun a medical-grade skin care regiment, 
                you must now. It takes 3-4 months to start to see the results, so this must be initiated by at least then 
                to see results and the glowing skin you envision for the special day. On the day of your wedding or event, 
                there are excellent products to use to exfoliate and ensure your makeup for the day goes on smoothly and 
                correctly, and most importantly, lasts.

            <h4 class="small-all-caps">
                SCHEDULE IT OUT. 
            </h4>
            <p>
                Unlike hair, nails and makeup, your skincare regiment and aesthetic treatments cannot be scheduled the 
                week of the wedding or event.Remember, you want to have everyone notice you but not see what you did! 
                Here are some popular options and the timeline you need to consider when preparing for your big day.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An initial consultation should be ideally a minimum of 4 months in advance of your big day so planning, 
                    dreaming and scheduling of appointments is doable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skin Care should be started 3-4 months in advance using a medical-grade product line with clear 
                    morning and evening routines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chemical peels and Micro needling should be started 3-4 months in advance of your event if you want to 
                    complete a 3-4 series. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Botox and other anti-wrinkle injections should be done a minimum of 1month in advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fillers should be done a minimum of 2 months in advance. 
                </li>
            </ul>
