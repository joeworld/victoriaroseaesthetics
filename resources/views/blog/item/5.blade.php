        </div>
        <p>
            What is the hype about that little bottle called Retinol is a question I get asked a lot! The Retinol 
            movement is a growing trend in home skincare and here's why.  The cornerstone of Retinol is Vitamin A,  
            which all human bodies are deficient in, and the smallest amount can make a monumental difference in your 
            skin. Retinol is one of the easiest and most effective ways to minimize your fine lines and wrinkles and
            improve pigmentation. Best of all, you use it at home.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to think of Retinol as a steady but powerful train that can get your skin where you want it to be. 
            Trains are an interesting but not the fastest form of transportation that offers stable comfort, clear 
            direction and can be lovely when the traveller is patient and takes in the view. The same is true of Retinol. 
            You need to choose the right one, be patient to get the results you want, and the trip is enhanced when you know 
            and follows the map along the way.
        </p>

            However, many Retinol users make some common but preventable mistakes that affect the results they have. '
            Here is what you need to know aboutRetinol to make sure it works for you.

                You can't just turn around if you are on the wrong train. You must get on the right train.

            <p>
                Retinol is a complex product and can be a little intimidating for a first time user.

                Retinol can either be low, moderate or high-level. ZO Skin Health provides three clear options to guide 
                your decision about what type of Retinol is best for you and your skin. Review this to help discern 
                the best Retinol option for you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Low 0.25% - is an excellent option for a beginning retinol user, who is looking to target specific 
                    areas that have weakened due to aging or sun-damaged.  If you have fine lines or wrinkles beginning 
                    in common spots on your face, a low-level dose is a great option.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moderate 0.5% -After your skin has become acclimatized to Retinol use,and you can slowly begin to 
                    use a moderate dose. This may take months or years, but at this dosage, you can use your Retinol 
                    daily and over the entire face.
                </li>
                <li>
                    High-Level 1% - After you have tried and used Retinol continually overtime, your skin will be 
                    accustomed to it and can tolerate the power of it.That preparation is necessary to move on to a 
                    high-level retinol product, where you will see the results! But please beware, as much as you want 
                    the results, diving into a high-level Retinol too quickly can cause reactions or excessive dryness 
                    and peeling.
                </li>
            </ul>

                PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE
            </h4>
            <p>
                A train is not necessarily your quickest mode of travel, but it can be quite enjoyable! Similarly, 
                Results are not instant with Retinol, but wow, when a user respects the instructions to a tee, 
                they are fantastic over time. I have seen too many people give up on this beautifully formulated 
                product simply because the results didn't come in time. Too many people do not reach their goals simply 
                because they gave up on them too early. Remember that withRetinol, you can only reach your goals if 
                you stay the course and stick to it.Tak  it slow and ensure your skin can handle the pace, speed 
                and momentum you are throwing at it.

                There is no doubt that if you are on a train ride, you will enjoy it more if you know the route to get 
                there and take in the view. If you are anything like me,you love to open a new package and tinker with 
                it, admire it and inspect it to see what it will do. Rarely do we go straight to the instructions and 
                carefully plan its use. If you do, you are going to be a recipient of the Retinol Results quicker than 
                the rest of us! With Retinol, following the instructions is so important! Misusing Retinol can wreak 
                havoc on your skin, waste your product, and the only results you will get are more skin problems than 
                ever.Usually, when it comes to Retinol, less is more. And also read up on warning about Retinol! For 
                example, always be extra careful with your sun exposure while you are using Retinol. Retinol makes your 
                skin acutely more sensitive to UV rays, so make sure that SPF sunscreen is always part of your morning 
                routine. You can read up more on the importance of SPF in my next blog.

                Radical Night Repair   
            </h4>
            <p>
                This powerful retinol night repair Peel treatment is fantastic for anti-aging and pigmentation. 
                Radical Night Repair is indeed "radical," so this peel is for you ONLY if your skin has had some 
                exposure to the beauty of Retinol. This aggressive peel stimulates new cell activity and collagen in 
                aging and sun-damaged skin effectively and quickly. This treatment is only recommended 2-3 times a 
                year and is for users who have been on Retinol 0.5% or higher for a minimum of 4-6 weeks. There is 
                downtime for this treatment because your skin will experience lots of peeling, but once your skin heals, 
                he results are amazing!
