        </div>
        <p>
        With so many different types of procedures to go with, I am often asked about what is going 
        to give the best results and bang for my buck in my clinic.
        </p>
        <h6>OFTEN, THE RESONATING ANSWER IS A CHEMICAL PEEL! </h6>
        <p>
            Facial peels have been used for decades to exfoliate and rejuvenate the skin. 
            Many people love to try a peel when they are first considering medical aesthetics because a peel is less 
            intimidating than some of the other injectable procedures that are offered and with the immediate results, 
            is often a game-changer in the enhanced feel and texture of our skin, a welcome boost in a short amount of 
            time, with minimal discomfort! A Chemical Peel is like exercise - Start with something comfortable! Considering 
            a peel may just be a great place to start with medical aesthetics.

            <h6>
                IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF A CHEMICAL PEEL IS A GOOD OPTION FOR YOU, ASK YOURSELF THESE 3 QUESTIONS:
            </h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Are you feeling like your skin has taken a beating from the sun exposure, blemishes 
                    or the tone and pigmentation of its colour and texture due to the natural impacts of aging?
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you look in the mirror, do you feel like your skin is dull and drab or is your skin colouring 
                    lacking a healthy glow that shines and evenness in colour?
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you book a chemical peel, are you ready to commit to protecting your skin from sun sensitivity 
                    for weeks after your treatment?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            If you answered yes to any or all of those questions, you probably will see a marked difference and 
            improved skin colour and tone from a chemical peel.
        </p>

        <p>
            While facial masks and peels can be available over the counter to provide temporary skin improvement 
            and a feeling of softness that we long for, a chemical peel offers a more long term solution to that 
            same softness and smoothness we desire.
        </p>

        <p>

            your skin. Rejuvenation of the skin with a peel yields a beautiful glow that you will feel inside and out!

        </p>

        <p>
            If you are wondering about a way to gently and yet significantly boost your facial skin attributes to a more youthful 
            and glowing look, a chemical peel may be your perfect answer.
