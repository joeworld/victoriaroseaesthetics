        <p>
            It’s that time of year again! Are you getting your New Year’s resolutions list going? 
        </p>
        <p>
            The pressure is on because guess what? There is a new decade here! This fact may be super
             inspiring or scaring you to death thinking about what you want for the next ten years of life.
             We also are fully aware we are ten years older than the last decade! Where does the time go? \
             Imagining your life and looks for the next decade and what it will hold probably has you thinking about 
             setting goals for your own self-care to allow you to enjoy all those dreams for love, life, and success.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know every one of us aspires to get better at our own self-care practices and hopes we will 
            age gracefully and beautifully. Most of us hope our skin will be timeless in some capacity! The 
            focus on our own self-care for mental, spiritual and emotional wellbeing has never been so poignantly 
            manifested in our minds.
        </p>
        <p>
            WAIT! Don’t worry! I got you. The timing of my business website and branding launch could not be more
            perfect to help you with your own goals.  Are you ready to make YOU the most important new year goal you have?
        </p>
        <p>
            When setting your goals for YOU at the beginning of this decade, I wasn’t kidding when I said I had you
            covered. I have so many options for helping you feel ready and rejuvenated whether it be to get through
            a harsh winter, prepare for the special event this year, or simply make your investment in your skin 
            that you will always be thankful you did.
        </p>

                1  . Skin Care Boot Camp is a must! 
            </h4>
            <p>
            While I am excited to see you for a treatment boost, 80% of what you do for your skin 
            begins at home, not in my lavish clinic. If you have not invested in a skincare process with 
            products that are proven to be effective and intentionally love your skin this is your number one MUST DO.

                2  . SPF without exception! 
            </h4>
            <p>
            It may feel like the dull of winter is upon us but your skin still needs protecting!
            There are fantastic products that are easy two-steps in one process. Save time and make sure you cover 
            up your beautiful face with protection.

            <p>
            Book with me to discuss what areas of your skin concern you, your budget and time considerations. 
            I can work with you to weave all of these criteria to find a procedure or treatment plan that works 
            to boost your beauty and have you feeling ready for the year and decade ahead. Contact me for a free 
            consult!

            Resolutions that begin with your own self-care and confidence are key to interconnect to all your 
            other goals. Your skin deserves the love this year. Let’s get Going
