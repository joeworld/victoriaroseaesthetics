        </div>
        <p>
            It is well documented that a woman's smile is one of the first and most important features others notice. 
            We all dream and love the idea of full,beautiful, soft lips. Makeup and skincare has developed so many 
            products to help create that look.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past few decades, there became a popular idea to pout out the lips by pressing them together for 
            posing. This phenomenon became a trend extending to celebrities and teenage selfies. Red carpet poses and 
            social media reflected it, and very quickly, lip fillers became introduced to help women achieve this look 
            more permanently.

            The trend is over ladies.

            <h4>
                THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FULL LIPS AND DUCK LIPS.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Sadly, I see so many women now coming to correct the “Duck Lips” or"Homer Simpson lips" that showcase 
                a look that was a fast-fading phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The truth is, Duck lips are not a look our culture loves or is a trend that considered chic anymore. 
                A big part of my job is correctional work to minimize volume above the top lip or below the bottom lip 
                that is, well, just too much. It is heartbreaking to see women who are so disappointed with the far from 
                natural lip fillers that have not achieved the results they had hoped for. I've had to dissolve a lot 
                of bad work and re-inject properly when it comes to lip fillers. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As much as I love to help correct, you might as well get it done right the first time! I love to educate 
            my patients and spend time gaging your goals to offer solutions that provide you with the best results.
            </p>

                The most common worry women now have is that lip injections may not look natural. The beautiful 
                thing about lip fillers is that they do not have to protrude or project your lips outwards. It 
                is the technique and the product that can help you achieve beautiful full lips with enhanced height 
                and eversion that will give you natural-looking results.
