                                Innovations in laser technology have produced a unique vaginal tightening treatment that is painless, non-invasive, and non-surgical. It emits infrared light and does not break the skin, allowing for a much more targeted, precise, and effective treatment with little to no risk of scarring, bleeding, or infection. Because er: YAG lasers are safe and relatively gentle, they are administered in several other medical applications.

                                For women who want to improve the look and feel of their vaginal area but are reluctant to undergo surgery, IntimaLase™ non-surgical vaginal tightening provides most of the benefits and almost none of the risk of traditional vaginoplasty. Patients can expect a tighter vaginal canal, with more muscle tone and control, which can restore the sensitivity lost as a result of reduced friction during intercourse.

                                Most patients report almost no discomfort, other than a warming sensation, eliminating the need for even local anesthesia.

                                Non-surgical laser vaginal tightening requires no pre or post-operative care, and patients can return to their daily activities immediately regarding the procedure.

                                Stress urinary incontinence can be caused by the stretching and weakening of the ligaments, nerves, and pelvic floor muscles that normally work together to support the bladder and keep the urethra closed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stress urinary incontinence can make patients feel highly self-conscious and embarrassed. Additionally, skin that comes in contact with urine often becomes irritated, so patients much always take precautions such as using incontinence pads. This can take a toll on self-confidence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IncontiLase is a specialized laser therapy to help treat moderate urinary incontinence. The Er. YAG laser treatment repairs tighten vaginal tissue and support the bladder. The non-ablative lasers will heat the target tissue without decimating them like other procedures. The process effectively signals your body to produce more collagen, which will gently resurface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a majority of patients, a single session is sufficient to alleviate mild or even moderate stress urinary incontinence. If needed, the treatment may be repeated after one month. No special pre-op preparations or post-op precautions are necessary. After treatment, you may immediately return to your normal activities. The procedure is non-surgical and virtually painless. Recovery is extremely quick without the need for the use of analgesics or antibiotics, patients can immediately resume their normal activities after their IncontiLase treatments.
