                                Enhance and re-sculpt the curves of your buttocks without the challenge of exercise or surgery. Feel confident with Sculptra butt lift to have a rounder, more contoured butt without increasing your muscle mass.
                                Sculptra butt lift uses a dermal filler injection to stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of your skin. These painless injections use poly-L-lactic acid to stimulate the growth of collagen and thickens the skin.  Over time, the patient will notice a visible volume difference in the buttocks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since collagen is the protein that gives your skin its structure and shape, Sculptra injections fill out the area beneath your butt promoting a more curved shape that looks natural and fits with your body type.
                                Recovery after a Sculptra butt lift is minimal. It can take 4 to 6 months for the results to become apparent, as the injection works to slowly boost your bodyâ€™s collagen production.
