                <br>
                <p>Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea. The main types of sleep apnea are: Obstructive sleep apnea, the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax.</p>

                    <div class="big-title">SNORING?</div>
                    <br>
                    <p>The sound can come through the nose, mouth or a combination of the two and can occur during any stage of sleep. Those who sleep on their backs are more likely to snore. It may also occur when throat muscles relax from use of alcohol or other depressants. Congestion from a cold or allergies may also lead to temporary snoring.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The NightLase therapy is a non-invasive, laser treatment for increasing the quality of a patient’s sleep by reducing the effects of sleep apnea and decreasing the amplitude of snoring. This is accomplished through a gentle, tightening effect on lax tissue in the oral mucosa tissue.</p>

                                            The Fotona Dynamis series uses a non-ablative Er:YAG laser. This laser is able to effectively stimulate skin tightening and collagen production in the back of the mouth, without removing tissue, thereby opening up the airways safely and naturally. The NightLase technology delivers a sequence of sub-ablative micro pulses that are delivered directly to the back of the throat. The laser modality optimizes the length of the laser pulses, thereby allowing the safe penetration of thermal energy, painlessly into the oral mucosa tissue. This laser is gentle enough to be used on an area as sensitive as the mouth, while still strong enough to provide clinically effective heating                                        </p>
